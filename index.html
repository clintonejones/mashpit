                <h3>Ãœberclaw IPL</h3>
                    <li>A smooth, light, hop forward lager Maggots!  Perfect for world domination, slaying the universe or general debauchery.  Even perfect for mowing the lawn or just a quiet evening when you just want to have 9 or 10 beers then be up for church the next morning.</li></td>
            <td>
                <h3>Steel Saison</h3>
                    <li>Medium bodied, effervescent and slightly tart..... just like your mom.  This saison is the perfect compliment to a hot afternoon or a light lunch..... just like your mom.</li></td>
            <td>
                <h3>Architechture of an Ale</h3>
                    <li id="Pale">The first sip of this beer is a hop forward experience that sticks to the skin of your teeth while it finished like ashes in your mouth.... yeah.  Anyway this is a popular, critically acclaimed, balanced beer, but you'll always swear that the pale ale we made before this one was the best thrash beer ever made.</li></td>

                <h3>Peter Steele Smoked Porter</h3>
                    <li id="pete">Shake off the October rust with this beer for those with a dark soul.  Smokey, Portery, Steel....ey? Look just drink the damn beer</li></td>
            <td>
                <h3>Oatmeal Stout</h3>
                    <li>Black as the winters of Norway and a body as thick as Gene Hogland, this stout has a smooth and silky mouthfeel from the generous helping of oats.  This beer goes down well on a cold night or even at your favorite metal venue.</li></td>
            <td>
                <h3>IPA</h3>
                <li>Fruity like Rob Halford, this beer hits the high notes with large amounts of Mosaic and New Zealand breed hops.  And with an abv of 6.7% this beer is a Pain Killer.</li></td>
